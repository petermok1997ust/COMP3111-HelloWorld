`act1` `minutes` `Gantt chart`

**Question: About Animated Chart.**

Should we use one of the two decided charts and make it into an animation? Or should we put animated chart as a separate generalization for a chart class?

There is no restriction. Teams can decide to implement multiple separated chart classes, or a generalized chart class with multiple subclasses, or an animate method in a chart.

Class attributes and operations should be included. Example in slide 15-16, UML Modeling 1 lecture

**Question: Assignment 1 submission detail**

Does it mean that UML class diagram(and use-case) for each member has to be different or all the members are expected to submit the same work?

`act1` `uml` `use case diagram` `class diagram`

The UML class/use-case diagram can be the same, or can be different. It won't count as plagiarism as the diagrams are agreed by the whole team. In any case, assignment 1 is an individual assessment.
